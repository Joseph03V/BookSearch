## Description

This application uses React.js along with MongoDB on the back end and graphQL. It allows users to signup/sign in, search for any book using a third party book api, and add or remove those books to a personal list of favorites. It implements JWT as the authentication, and local  
storage to reduce db loads. The entire app runs off of Apollo server/client.
